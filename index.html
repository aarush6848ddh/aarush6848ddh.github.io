<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Hi, My name is Aarush and I am a Junior in highschool who is attending ACC through the highschool partnership program. I am currently interested in the line of Computer Science, mostly the Artificial intelligence side. My dad works in Computer Science as a Solutions Architect so he helps and guides me a lot. I currently live in South Windsor, CT, and love to spend time outdoors playing sports like basketball, football, and cricket. I also love helping people out in my community.</p>

<h2>My Non-Profit</h2>
<p>Me and and a few high schoolers have come together to create a non profit business with goal of teaching computer science through a neurological standpoint and also using other bio related topics. We also collaborate with professors to conduct research projects. We are currently making networks with multiple schools to start up clubs where Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and neural networks would be taught. The website to it can be found <a href=https://neurocoding.godaddysites.com/>here.</a></p>
